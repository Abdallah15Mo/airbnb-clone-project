# airbnb-clone-project

# Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to replicate core functionalities of a booking platform like Airbnb. The goal is to create a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform that allows users to list, discover, and book accommodations. This project leverages modern backend frameworks, database systems, and CI/CD pipelines to simulate real-world software development practices, focusing on collaborative workflows, API security, and robust database design.

## Technology Stack
- **Django**: A Python-based web framework used for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic, enabling rapid development and secure application structure.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database management system used for storing and managing data, offering robust support for complex queries and scalability.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request specific data, improving efficiency and flexibility in data retrieval.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
  
## Database Design
- **Users**: Fields: `user_id` (primary key), `email`, `password_hash`, `name`, `phone`. Relationships: A user can own multiple properties and create multiple bookings or reviews.
- **Properties**: Fields: `property_id` (primary key), `owner_id` (foreign key to Users), `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`. Relationships: A property belongs to one user and can have multiple bookings and reviews.
- **Bookings**: Fields: `booking_id` (primary key), `property_id` (foreign key to Properties), `user_id` (foreign key to Users), `start_date`, `end_date`. Relationships: A booking is associated with one property and one user.
- **Reviews**: Fields: `review_id` (primary key), `property_id` (foreign key to Properties), `user_id` (foreign key to Users), `rating`, `comment`. Relationships: A review is linked to one property and one user.
- **Payments**: Fields: `payment_id` (primary key), `booking_id` (foreign key to Bookings), `amount`, `payment_date`, `status`. Relationships: A payment is tied to one booking.
 ## Feature Breakdown

1. User Management  
This feature handles user registration, login, and profile management. It ensures that users can securely access their accounts and manage their personal details with authentication and authorization.

2. Property Management  
Users can add, edit, and delete property listings. This enables property owners to showcase available properties, manage listings, and keep information up to date.

3. Booking System  
The booking system allows users to view property availability and make reservations. It manages scheduling, prevents double bookings, and facilitates smooth communication between renters and property owners.

4. Payment Integration  
Secure payment processing is included to handle transactions. This ensures users can pay for bookings safely and owners can receive payments efficiently.

5. Admin Dashboard  
Admins have access to manage users, properties, and bookings from a centralized dashboard. This supports system-wide oversight and maintenance of platform integrity.

## API Security
- **Authentication**: Implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth to verify user identities, protecting endpoints from unauthorized access.
- **Authorization**: Uses role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict actions based on user roles, ensuring users only access permitted resources.
- **Rate Limiting**: Caps the number of API requests per user to prevent abuse and maintain server performance, critical for scalability.
- **Data Protection**: Employs HTTPS and encryption for sensitive data (e.g., payment details), safeguarding user information and transactions.

Security is vital to protect user data, prevent fraud in payments, and maintain trust in the platform, especially for financial transactions and personal information.

## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code, ensuring faster and more reliable releases. They are crucial for maintaining code quality, catching errors early, and enabling seamless collaboration in team environments. Tools like **GitHub Actions** can be used to define workflows for running tests and deploying to production, while **Docker** ensures consistent environments across development stages.
